## üéØ Purpose

These documents were created to support:

1. **Immediate (2 days):** Client presentation for network-sync prototype
2. **Short-term (12 weeks):** Production roadmap implementation
3. **Long-term:** Knowledge transfer and project management

## üìä Key Findings

**Network-Sync Score: 7.0/10**
- Highly innovative multi-agent AI orchestration
- In-house Memory SDK creates competitive moat
- Production-ready in 12 weeks with phased approach

**Social-Connect Score: 7.5/10**
- More production-ready (75% complete)
- Simpler architecture, easier to maintain
- Standard feature set, less differentiation

## üöÄ Recommendation

**Present network-sync** for the client demo because:
- Hit the target execution (vs social-connect's first attempt)
- Multi-agent AI orchestration is genuinely innovative
- In-house Memory SDK is a significant differentiator
- Clear 12-week roadmap to production-ready
