I understand you want to build an intelligent orchestration system that leverages different LLM agents for their specialized strengths, with automated report storage and content generation capabilities. Let me break this down into an executable plan for your social media app.

## ðŸ§© Execution To-Do List

### Phase 1: Architecture Setup
- [ ] Set up agent orchestration layer
- [ ] Configure LLM routing logic
- [ ] Implement Google Drive integration for reports
- [ ] Create vector storage system
- [ ] Build content generation pipeline

### Phase 2: File Structure & Implementation

Let me help you set up this multi-agent system in your social media app. First, let's examine your current project structure:Great! I can see you already have some foundation files. Now let's create a robust multi-agent orchestration system:

## Step 1: Create Agent Orchestration Core

**Navigate to:** `/Users/Seye/Documents/REPO/social media app`

**Create new file:** `agent-orchestrator.ts`## Step 2: Create Individual Agent Implementations

**Create folder:** `agents`**Create:** `agents/perplexity-agent.ts`**Create:** `agents/claude-agent.ts`## Step 3: Create Storage Systems

**Create folder:** `storage`**Create:** `storage/vector-store.ts`## Step 4: Create Usage Example

**Create:** `example-usage.ts`## Step 5: Create Environment Configuration

**Create:** `.env.example`## Step 6: Setup Instructions

**Create:** `package.json` updates## âœ… Post-Setup Actions

Now run these commands in your terminal:

```sh
cd "/Users/Seye/Documents/REPO/social media app"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys

# Run the demo
npm run demo
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Agent Orchestration**
- Intelligent task routing based on agent strengths
- Perplexity for real-time research
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for premium writing
- Embedding agent for vector analytics

### 2. **Automated Storage**
- Google Drive integration for reports
- Topic-based folder organization
- Vector database for semantic search
- Automatic report generation from research

### 3. **Content Pipeline**
- Research â†’ Writing â†’ Distribution flow
- Platform-specific content adaptation
- A/B testing variations
- Brand voice consistency

### 4. **Real-World Benefits**
- **Performance**: Tasks routed to fastest/best agent
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses cheaper agents when appropriate
- **Quality**: Leverages each agent's strengths
- **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention needed

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Add More Agents**:
   - GPT-4 for code generation
   - Gemini for multimodal tasks
   - Local LLMs for privacy-sensitive data

2. **Enhance Analytics**:
   - Performance tracking dashboard
   - Cost analysis per task
   - Success rate monitoring

3. **Implement Webhooks**:
   - Real-time status updates
   - Integration with Slack/Discord
   - Automated reporting

4. **Scale Infrastructure**:
   - Queue management with Redis
   - Distributed processing
   - Load balancing

The system is now ready to intelligently orchestrate different AI agents based on their strengths, automatically store reports in organized Google Drive folders, and maintain a searchable vector database of all generated content!
